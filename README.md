Howerver, there are some rules you should notice

- *README* is required for each directory, it describes your directory's structure.
- When using proper nouns as file/directory names, they should be capitalized. For example, `GNN/GCN.pdf`.
- General file/directory names need to be all lowercase, and words should be separated by `_`. For example, `how_to_add_file.md`.
